**Project Title:** Validation of a Gamified Measure of Processing Speed

**Project Description**

Background: *TODO*: maybe just add one paragraph about the importance, correlates and neural basis of processing speed with a couple of references (but not too much). 

Aim: The present study seeks to validate and optimize a simple reaction time task by (1) testing the impact of gamification on processing speed and task engagement and (2) assessing the optimal parameter values (number of trials and ISI range) for a robust yet efficient measure.


The procedure involves the following phases:


- Consent form: Before the experiment begins, participants will have an opportunity to read through information about the study. 
Participants will be informed that their response and participation will be kept confidential and anonymous (no IP address, or any identifiers are collected), and that the anonymised dataset may be made available for use of other researchers. 
Participants will have the opportunity to withdraw consent at the end of the experiment.

- Demographic information: A standard demographic survey will be presented to participants, including questions about age, gender, self-described ethnicity and education level. 
The goal is to be able to describe the sample with fidelity to prevent over-generalization of the results.

- Task: Participants will complete a simple reaction time task in two versions (presented in a randomized order): basic and gamified. 
The basic version will consist of a simple RT task with a red square appearing on the screen, and participants will be asked to press a key as quickly as possible. 
The gamified version will be a similar task but with gamified graphics, mechanics and a narrative (a dog that must get bones as fast as possible). 

- Post-task questionnaires: After each task, participants will be asked how long they feel the task lasted and how happy they would be to repeat it.

- Risks: There are no risks involved in this study.

**Section B**

- B.1: <font color="red">(kept from fakeface2)</font> Study will attempt to recruit a minimum of 100 participants (based on typical samples of similar studies), with no exclusion criteria.
- B.2: <font color="red">(kept from fakeface2)</font> Participants will be recruited via convenience sampling (e.g., via social media), or via other recruitment platforms if available (e.g., SONA, Prolific). The samples from different methods of recruitment will be collected separately in case they are different (the incentive type - e.g., student credits - and amount - or lack thereof - will thus be known to mitigate its potential effect). As we aim at recruiting a diverse sample, there are no exclusion criteria.
