**Project Title:** Doggo/Nogo: validation of a gamified simple reaction time task

**Project Description**

The present study seeks to (a) optimise the number of trials and inter-trial interval for a simple reaction time (RT) task, and (b) compare performance between a basic and a gamified version of the simple RT task.

- Consent form

Before the experiment begins, participants will have an opportunity to read through information about the study. Participants will be informed that their response and participation will be kept confidential and anonymous (no IP address, or any identifiers are collected), and that the anonymised dataset may be made available for use of other researchers. Participants will have the opportunity to withdraw consent at the end of the experiment.

- Demographic information

Age, gender

- Questionnaires



- Experimental stages

1) Two versions of a simple RT task presented in random order
  a) Gamified: 
  b) Basic: 
2) After each of the tasks, participants will be asked how long they feel the task lasted and how happy they would be to repeat it. 

- Debriefing

Participants will be given further information at the end of the study, <font color="red">?? including a link to the online repository where the results will be made accessible??</font> and an option to withdraw consent. 

- Randomization

The order of the two versions of the task (gamified vs. basic) will be randomised.

- Participants

<font color="red">(kept from fakeface2)</font> Participants will be recruited via convenience sampling (e.g., via social media), or via other recruitment platforms if available (e.g., SONA, Prolific). The samples from different methods of recruitment will be collected separately in case they are different (the incentive type - e.g., student credits - and amount - or lack thereof - will thus be known to mitigate its potential effect).
As we aim at recruiting a diverse sample, there are no exclusion criteria.

- Risks

There are no risks involved in this study.

**Section A**

No.

**Section B**

- B.1: <font color="red">(kept from fakeface2)</font> Study will attempt to recruit a minimum of 100 participants (based on typical samples of similar studies), with no exclusion criteria.
- B.2: <font color="red">(kept from fakeface2)</font> Participants will be recruited via convenience sampling (e.g., via social media), or via other recruitment platforms if available (e.g., SONA, Prolific). The samples from different methods of recruitment will be collected separately in case they are different (the incentive type - e.g., student credits - and amount - or lack thereof - will thus be known to mitigate its potential effect).
