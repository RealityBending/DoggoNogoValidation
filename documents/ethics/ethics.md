**Project Title:** Validation of a Gamified Measure of Processing Speed

**Project Description**

Background:

Processing speed is an element of cognitive control describing the duration between being exposed to a stimulus and purposefully responding to it. Quick processing facilitates cognitive efficiency (e.g., being able to complete an exam in the allocated time) and personal safety; a driver breaks on seeing a car pull into the road ahead; medical staff move away from a patient on hearing 'clear'. Processing speed can be compromised temporarily, for example, from sleep deprivation (Bougard et al., 2015). It can also be chronically impaired, for example, in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (Sivakolundu et al., 2020), or mental health conditions such as schizophrenia (Panagiotaropoulou et al., 2019) or bipolar disorder (Little et al., 2024). When processing speed is compromised, response time (RT) increases; the student may not get through all the exam questions; the driver may crash; the staff member may receive a nasty shock.

From a neural standpoint, changes in processing speed may occur as a result of disruption in the broader cognitive control network, described by Cole and Schneider (2007) as comprising the anterior cingulate cortex/pre-supplementary motor area, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal junction, anterior insular cortex, dorsal pre-motor cortex, and posterior parietal cortex. Specifically, processing speed has been associated with abnormal activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Panagiotaropoulou et al., 2019), and reduced fronto-parietal activation (Basner et al., 2013).

Aim: The present study seeks to validate and optimize a simple reaction time task by (1) testing the impact of gamification on processing speed and task engagement and (2) assessing the optimal parameter values (number of trials and ISI range) for a robust yet efficient measure.

The procedure involves the following phases:


- Consent form: Before the experiment begins, participants will have an opportunity to read through information about the study. 
Participants will be informed that their response and participation will be kept confidential and anonymous (no IP address, or any identifiers are collected), and that the anonymised dataset may be made available for use of other researchers. 
Participants will have the opportunity to withdraw consent at the end of the experiment.

- Demographic information: A standard demographic survey will be presented to participants, including questions about age, gender, self-described ethnicity and education level. The goal is to be able to describe the sample with fidelity to prevent over-generalization of the results.

- Task: Participants will complete a simple reaction time task in two versions (presented in a randomized order): basic and gamified. 
The basic version will consist of a simple RT task with a red square appearing on the screen, and participants will be asked to press a key as quickly as possible. 
The gamified version will be a similar task but with gamified graphics, mechanics and a narrative (a dog that must get bones as fast as possible). 

- Post-task questionnaires: After each task, participants will be asked to rate their enjoyment of the task, how long they feel the task lasted and how happy they would be to repeat it.

- Convergent validity measure: Participants will complete a 9-item Raven's progressive matrices (Bilker et al., 2012) which is used to assess fluid intelligence

- Risks: There are no risks involved in this study.

No.

**Section B**

- B.1: Study will attempt to recruit a minimum of 30 participants (based on typical samples of similar studies), with only fluency in english as inclusion criteria.
- B.2: Participants will be recruited via convenience sampling (e.g., via social media), or via other recruitment platforms if available (e.g., SONA, Prolific). The samples from different methods of recruitment will be collected separately in case they are different (the incentive type - e.g., student credits - and amount - or lack thereof - will thus be known to mitigate its potential effect). As we aim at recruiting a diverse sample, the only inclusion criteria is fluency in english.
- B.3: The study will be completed online and involves some self-completion questions
